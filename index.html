                            As the tech and IT industry started to take over the business world, SecurTech Solutions realized it’s potential and how it could revolutionize the whole business fraternity.
                            But with revolutions also come challenges. To become a part of the revolution and contribute it’s share in the transformation, SecurTech Solutions decided to take the role of an IT services and solutions provider to facilitate businesses making optimum use of technology.
                            Being a pioneer IT solutions provider, SecurTech Solutions has spent decades providing IT support to different businesses across various niches through it’s services and has helped them achieve their goals. 
                            During our service, many professionals have joined us who are considered the champions of their profession. At present, we are a team of some of the very best professionals in the business. Each member of our team is adequately qualified and highly experienced to do justice to assigned responsibilities.
                            SecurTech Solutions has a strict policy against over-burdening and only assigns a task to a person who is well-suited to perform, rather than hiring a jack of all trades, master of none. This is why our employees have been working with us for decades and have committed their expertise to add to the company's reputation.
                            Similarly, SecurTech Solution has always believed in continuous evolution and, for this reason, has always strived to bring advancement in its technology, solutions, and services. We have a designated unit of most senior professionals dedicated to improving our services and developing valuable innovations in solutions so that we can provide our clients with the best possible solutions.
                            This pursuit has enabled us to stay ahead of the competition and maintain our pioneer status. You can see the practical demonstration in our solutions as we are offering Cryptocurrency mining, which is still a newer concept. The world is still trying to get the hang of it, let alone providing this service.
                            This hustle has resulted in us serving some of the most prominent businesses in different industries, which is a testimonial to the quality of our services. Our portfolio is so sound and diverse now that there will hardly be a business field that uses IT, and we do not have a client in it.
                            Besides being home to the best professionals and partners to big businesses, we also enjoy a distinct position in the IT market because of the modernity we have brought to this field. 
                            As our client, you will barely see a pre-built solution in implementation as we treat each client with a unique solution, custom-made to suit their needs and designed to give the best output in their environment and in accordance with their goals.
                            In the future, SecurTech Solutions plans to add further services to it’s list as the IT sector evolves, as there is room for expansion while maintaining it’s world-class standard of services.

A computer network virtually connects the employees of a company and gives them access to a hub called the server, where the company's critical data is stored.
                                                                    Initially, only one computer is enough to handle all the company's data, but as a company expands, it needs to integrate more computers. As a computer network grows, it faces different problems.
                                                                    The problems don’t only harm the computer network, they also seriously affect the company’s performance, setting it behind and decreasing the productivity of it’s employees. It makes it harder for the employees to use the network and deliver proficiently.
                                                                    In addition to that, computer network problems also make the company vulnerable to cyberattacks, resulting in security breaches and sensitive data leaks.
                                                                    Initially, a single IT professional, and later on, an in-house moderately expert IT team might be enough to handle computer networks, but before long, matters start to get out of their hands.

Not just that, a security and surveillance system can also be effective to intimidate potential offenders with the fear of being watched and can prevent them from causing any harm.
                                                            If they still don’t stop, a security and surveillance system can provide you with the concrete evidence you will need to bring the criminals to justice.

                                                                For starters, the server is cloud-based, so nothing is hosted on your premises, which straight away means cost reduction on utility bills. Furthermore, as we host the server, we keep it under check all the time, so the maintenance becomes an ongoing and continuous process rather than a scheduled process. It makes cloud-based server media hosting much more reliable.
                                                                Moreover, if the server ever crashes or encounters a problem, chances are high that our experts will be able to detect and fix it before your employees can even notice it so that the pace of your process does not get disturbed.
                                                                Another advantage of our cloud-based services is that you can access them from anywhere in the world without having to be bound to a specific place. It can allow your employees to work remotely and share data with their colleagues virtually. It can also boost productivity as an employee will not have to come all the way to the office to share a file if he is on leave, nor will your work get hampered just because an employee is absent.

                Having an in-house IT team can partially solve the problem, but even that would not be enough to eliminate the issue because the team cannot stay on location all the time.
                To help you with this problem and make things easier for your business, SecurTech Solutions provides 24/7 prompt IT support exclusively to it’s clients so that you can have a team of IT professionals at your disposal whenever you need their assistance.
                Our customer support team is trained to provide both quality customer care as well as efficient problem-solving. Furthermore, if for some reason our agents are not capable of solving your problems, you will be directed to a senior professional who will be more experienced and better equipped to handle the issue, as we SecurTech Solutions work around the clock in multiple shifts.
                The best part of our customer support service is not our quick response, polite behaviour and exceptional problem-solving skills; it is our welcoming nature. It means you do not have to wait until a problem occurs to contact us; you can do it as soon as you feel any inconvenience with any of our systems so that our agents can guide you, save your time and effort and keep the issue from aggravating.

                Maintaining a supply of IT tech equipment is not feasible for businesses that require IT but do not deal in it as this will bind their money and only provide benefit when the need arises.
So whenever there is a problem, the IT department has to arrange the equipment first and then move towards the resolution of the issue. Luckily, it would not be a problem for you if SecurTech Solutions is your IT partner because we have a good stock of the most frequently required equipment.
Keeping the stock is feasible because we have to regularly fix the problems of hundreds of our clients, and it helps us keep our service efficient and operation smooth. 
If there is something that we do not already have, SecurTech Solutions can make it available within a matter of minutes because of the sound connections and reputation it has earned throughout its service.
With SecurTech Solutions by your side, you will get seamless and quick tech support on the spot without the hassle or wait.

                Instead, we offer regular maintenance sessions to check and maintain your systems and infrastructure to ensure everything is prim and proper and there is no underlying issue.
We will check hardware, software, wiring, integrations, configurations and overall set-up to ensure that the system delivers its best performance. If we notice any issues, we get you on board and fix it right away before it becomes a source of any problem.
Similarly, if something is potentially depleting and needs replacement, we will propose its timely replacement before it can cause any trouble to you.
Moreover, the maintenance sessions also focus on free of cost improvement of the infrastructure with each visit to make up for any shortcomings left while building it.
This good conduct and fair policy has earned us the trust of our clients and has enabled us to retain them ever since they first collaborated with us.

                This is why we look forward to our clients to challenge us out of our comfort zone and give us an opportunity to do something novel and innovative.
SecurTech Solutions offers custom IT solutions, which are solutions custom-made for unusual problems. The solution can be in the form of new integration, feature or application. 
For custom IT solutions, we use tried and tested methods of engineering design, in which we follow a step-by-step process beginning with understanding the problem in technical terms and coming up with a hypothetically ideal solution for it.
Then, we brainstorm ideas, come up with designs, critique and improve them until we propose them to our clients. Upon approval, we prepare their prototypes, after which the solutions are good to be deployed.
The whole process is carried out keeping clients requirements, budget and timeframe under consideration so that everything happens as per their wish.
